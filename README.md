# ZipfsLawDictionary

## Project Aim
In this project, we intend to create a dictionary of words ranked according to Zipf's law. For this purpose, we send a request to Wikipedia for random pages. Once the text of these Wikipedia articles has been extracted, we rank these words by frequency.

## How to use?
Please find attached a .txt file that contains a mostly correct representation of Zipfs law for the English language.  The list attached is not a completely accurate representation because it uses random Wikipedia pages, and there are only 10,000 Wikipedia pages that were used. However, it should be adequate for most purposes.

## Technology Requirements
* Python 3.6.12
* Selenium 4.0
* Beautiful soup 4.9.0
