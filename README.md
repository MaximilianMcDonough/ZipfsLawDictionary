# ZipfsLawDictionary

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to create a dictionary of words that is ranked in order according to Zipfs law. in order to accomplish this we send get request to wikipedia asking for random pages. once we have these wiki articles we exctract thetext and rank each word according to its frequency

## How to use?
If you dont want to run the proram yourself I included a .txt file that you can downlad and use that countains a mostly correct representation of Zipfs law for the English laungudge. It's not a compleatly correct representation because it uses random Wikipedia pages and there where only 10,000 pages that where used to creat the list attached
